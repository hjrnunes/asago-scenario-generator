# Adaptive redesign revision record

This is the append-only revision record for the adaptive scenario/artifact ownership
redesign. It records the commits made on this branch after the starting pins. Never
rewrite the starting pins in `build/adaptive-redesign-inputs/manifest.json`; add a new
entry here instead.

`python3 build/adaptive-redesign-inputs/verify.py` asserts `HEAD` equals the starting
commits and requires clean tracked trees. After the first implementation commit those
two checks fail by design. The file-hash, plan-hash and configuration-reference checks
must keep passing at all times. A failure of any of those is a real pin violation.

## Starting pins (immutable, from `build/adaptive-redesign-inputs/manifest.json`)
